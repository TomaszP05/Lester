### Description
Lester is a social kindness application developed on Flutter/Dart, designed to encourage users to achieve small daily acts of kindness challenges that anyone can do. These challenges can help promote positivity and wellness in users’ daily lives. Once a user enters the application, a kindness challenge will be displayed, where users have the option to complete it or select another challenge. Additionally, users can write a journal entry daily to write thoughts and feelings, reflecting how a kindness challenge that day brought wellness to their lives, as well as other small features to make the app complete.
